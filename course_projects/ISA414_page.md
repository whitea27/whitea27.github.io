## Managing Big Data Final Project
### Project Description: 
Our group chose to investigate the sentiment of passengers after an announcement by Southwest Airlines. This announcement declared that they would now require payment to check luggage, changing their previous free checked bag policy. In order to evaluate the public and investor perspective we chose to scrape a Reddit thread talking about the change and Southwest stock prices.
