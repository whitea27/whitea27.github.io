2025-03-11 11:12,"If I were Delta, United, or American, I’d be tripling my ad budget to try to score SW defectors."
2025-03-11 10:55,It will make the battle for overhead storage even worse.
2025-03-11 11:06,"From another article: “In September, Southwest’s then chief transformation officer, Ryan Green, told analysts that its analysis showed Southwest would lose more money from passengers defecting to rivals if it started charging for bags than it would make from the fees.“ Then they fired him. Family of four here. Credit card holder for 12 years (just passed the annual fee, because of course). Loyal southwest flyers who’ve been increasingly annoyed with the company since 2022. Take your one free bag and shove it up your ass."
2025-03-11 10:53,That was really the main reason I stayed with southwest. No reason to stay with them now
2025-03-11 11:03,"Oof, gut punch and likely the last straw for my loyalty. Just another airline now and will choose my carrier based on lowest total price now. Off to trade in my SW CCs for their United counterparts."
2025-03-11 11:00,So much of SWA's marketing has been centered on the free bag policy for so long. I suspect backlash to this will be strong.
2025-03-11 11:17,"In order to earn revenue, people must have a reason to choose your airline. People give Spirit crap, but there is a reason why you would pick them. There is a reason you’d pick United or Delta. Why Southwest? Are they the cheapest? No…see spirit Free bags? No Free seat selection? No…see UA, DL, AA Airline Lounge? No….see UA, DL, AA, others Companion Pass? Yes, until they kill it. Good In Flight Entertainment? No…UA has Bluetooth screens now Unless you are hitting Companion pass or they are the only nonstop, why fly SWA?"
2025-03-11 11:43,"As an employee this is honestly the worst thing they have ever done, nothing separates them from any other competitor now."
2025-03-11 10:56,"Thank you Elliot management, for once again, proving that America is nothing more than a bunch of blood sucking private equity and investment firms always leeching their way into the wallets of hard-working American families. Everything is being hollowed out in the name of short-term return. Fuck capitalism. Fuck Southwest."
2025-03-11 11:18,RIP southwest.
2025-03-11 11:23,Wow. Just wow. They want to kill their brand for short term thinking. Just sad.
2025-03-11 10:58,How long til the companion pass gets axed?
2025-03-11 11:00,"Did anyone else see the news stated in the CNBC article that SOME flight credits will expire? All these changes for an airline that is more expensive, is usually in the worst airport terminals, no lounges, no special perks. Only domestic. The writing on this wall is crazy! How can a company make this many big changes in such a short time frame????"
2025-03-11 11:10,I wish BWI wasn’t my local airport since it’s a southwest hub. It’s going to be hard to switch over with the number of direct flights. But I’m going to try and switch out of pure spite
2025-03-11 12:05,Oh bitch! Herb is rolling the fuck over in his grave. I hope he haunts all those money hungry punkasses smh They’re going to learn that SW wont stand a gotdamn chance against the big 3 if they operate with them trying to compete. Their product isn’t that great in comparison. It was the best low cost carrier. Meaning sw> spirit/frontier etc…
2025-03-11 10:55,I guess I'll be using up my SW gift cards/flight credits and then finding a new airline.
2025-03-11 11:20,Fun Fact. You can get a free checked bag on Delta if you have their Amex card. Just saying.
2025-03-11 10:56,"Good luck with that 10% goal now, Bob... I honestly think Elliott wants the airline to go bankrupt so they can force a merger."
2025-03-11 11:00,With this and assigned seats now what makes it different than other airlines
2025-03-11 10:50,We all knew it was coming eventually. Zero chance now for any loyalty from myself and A LOT of family members.
2025-03-11 11:10,Private equity at its best
2025-03-11 11:18,Looks like I’ll be flying Alaska now. I’ll be able to get from SAN to PDX in 2 hours vs 4. Free bags was the only thing that kept me loyal all these years.
2025-03-11 11:37,Wow. Called it. Thank god my last flight with them was 3 weeks ago. Have fun with Spirit 2.0.
2025-03-11 13:06,"Ok, that’s enough. I’m out. Decades of flying with them, holding their CC, and evangelizing for them only to keep being slapped in the face? No, thanks. I’ll finish my flights in a couple weeks, use up my last 70k points, and cut ties. The worst part is the Stockholm Syndrome from not wanting the credit hit from canceling such an old card. They’re playing like their ticket prices are still competitive and people still have a reason to fly with them."
2025-03-11 11:50,"Welp, my loyalty is gone for this company. Don’t fly enough for A-list but it was the only airline I flew. About 4 times a year. I’ve never seen a company self-destruct so fast."
2025-03-11 12:15,I’m more pissed about them putting expiration dates on flight credits with this new change - forces people to book something within a year or lose the credits
2025-03-11 11:06,"Unless fares drop, or with the baggage fee they are still cheaper than other carriers I’ll definitely be shopping around more now. Southwest flights I take usually involve a layover which was tolerable with the perk of free bags and not having to deal with bags since I had checked them. But now I’m not so sure about that."
2025-03-11 11:13,At this point why even fly southwest (other than maybe being the only non stop offer on some flights for me)? If you add on bag fees many airlines are the same cost.
2025-03-11 11:25,No reason to stick with Southwest anymore
2025-03-11 11:29,Ugh. Going to make carryon space that much worse.
2025-03-11 11:30,"Lmao. I wish I saved comments from all the *geniuses* who said Southwest wouldn't possibly move towards charging for bags after we saw Elliot, assigned seats, charging for ""premium"", fewer free drinks, fewer snacks, layoffs, no notice devals, etc etc. Fuck LUV"

2025-03-11 13:23,"This is the message I'm sharing with Southwest after getting their email. I encourage you also to share your [feedback](https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us) (link is to SW official feedback page). ""This is a sad day for Southwest and an about-face from Bob, the management, and the company that Herb, Gary, and Rollin built. It is shameful to insinuate that we should trust anything that Southwest says after promising, swearing, and looking passengers in the eye to tell them that checked bags will stay. We fly Southwest because we have a family and need to check extra bags for our kids. We upgrade when we can, but we never choose Business. We've been card carriers for over a decade, but what's the point? At the rates Southwest charges, and now to pay for our bags, we could fly Delta, American, or United. The heart so elegantly added to the belly of each plane, so you knew that Southwest cared about you from up above as it does from on the ground, is broken."""
2025-03-11 11:27,What a shame. As always private equity destroying good American companies.
2025-03-11 11:31,"And they were singin’, bye bye, Southwest Airlines"
2025-03-11 12:55,"There’s a few things I find interesting about this. 1.) Thinking they offer a service unique enough to do this. The whole thing that made them unique was this policy. Now, you’re going to pay the same as the larger airlines with less amenities which matter even more. They have comfortable seats…I guess. 2.) Southwest has already gotten fairly expensive, at least in my area which is a small hub. In many cases it’s only a little extra to fly Delta, or even cheaper, so no reason for me to even consider Southwest anymore. 3.) To piggyback off of point 2, are they going to reduce the price of theirs fairs at all since it already included the price of baggage? Or are they just planning on adding another 10-25% to their fairs after the fee for baggage? If it’s the latter, I think they’re in for a rude awakening. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s amended for certain cardholders to get free baggage, which I personally think would be the best option."
2025-03-11 11:34,"I don't fly enough to get status for any airline, so I guess I'll just use up my points and just find out what's cheaper near me now."
2025-03-11 11:51,I knew once they changed seating policy supposedly to benefit customers it would do this. I won't fly them again. No reason to sake cost as other better airlines now.
2025-03-11 11:43,"Puts on LUV I expected this. However I would agree with the leadership expectation that this will cause any gains realized by bag fees to be clawed back by lost customer loyalty or efficiency. Not checking bags will absolutely destroy their turn around time. They aren’t going to realize their margin growth, which means something else will get gutted."
2025-03-11 11:08,"Couldn’t the sudden switch be a false advertising situation? “Bags fly free” and the schedule has been open through October for a while. I’m not the only one with flights booked past May 28. Edit to add: I’m sure there’s fine print somewhere, it’s just shady as shit for them to do this timing wise."
2025-03-11 11:52,"Yeah, we will use up our remaining credits/points and be done. This was the only thing keeping them cheaper than Delta for us (and Delta offers more nonstops). I'm sad though. We've really enjoyed Southwest over the years and it's a genuine shame what a group of greedy people can do."
2025-03-11 12:19,"This is exactly why Congress should require that airlines give every passenger a carry-on OR a checked bag (except for basic economy type tickets). Everyone fights over overhead space because it's free, while the checked bag is not. Southwest was the one exception. Now that's gone, and everyone will be fighting over overhead space like all the other airlines."
2025-03-11 12:24,Hilariously dumb. That email this morning is the end of what makes Southwest special.
2025-03-11 10:58,That didn’t take long.
2025-03-11 12:29,"A former boss told me it’s always important to be aware of your place in the world. Southwest does not seem to know their place in the world. I’ll still fly them occasionally because my airport is fast becoming a hub for them, but will no longer go out of my way to fly with them."
2025-03-11 13:58,"Everything that made SWA my go to is now gone, they just speed ran destroying a brand"
2025-03-11 12:07,We all knew this was coming the moment Elliot showed up. I don't blame Elliot for doing what they do best. I blame SWA for the poor leadership and ultimate demise of a once fantastic airline. I fear SWA will be much smaller in the coming years.
2025-03-11 12:21,This is the last reason I would prioritize flying SW. My last few flying experiences with them have been trash. They delayed my last flight by 6 hours and made me miss my connecting. Before that I got stuck at MDW for hours bc of delays. Their prices have gone insane. Almost $900 to fly to Seattle in early December. I liked open seating and they’re changing like - most likely to charge for seats. Idk who is making decisions there but this is all so disappointing
2025-03-11 14:14,"How are they going to be able to keep the ""quick"" turnaround time for boarding? Many more people will bring carry-ons to get around the baggage fee, and that's going to delay boarding and departure."
2025-03-11 14:15,They literally promised not to do this and they base their whole entire identity off of free bags. I'm sure this will look wonderful for branding 🙄
2025-03-11 12:47,"We fly from ATL to MCO about 6 - 8 times per year, and always with Southwest. With the recent flights being pulled from ATL to where there are only 3 direct offerings, now the new changes of no free checked bags, increased cost to that of other airlines, we will more than likely be switching to Delta. If the perks and the cost are now going be the same, at least we will get more flight time options with the change of airline."
2025-03-11 13:13,"Southwest used to be my favorite airline because they did not nickel and dime on baggage....now they are just like the rest ...,and often they are higher too so no reason to seek them out anymore. They were always my preferred airline and if only like 75.00 more I would pick them over a cheaper airline because the bag policy. Also dislike the seat thing as well I liked being able to seat anywhere that is available"
2025-03-11 14:33,Time for a new CEO who isn’t scared of Elliott. The end of SWA is near.
2025-03-11 12:44,I’ve posted this before on other related threads. My son’s hockey team just had a tournament in Nashville. There were 2 other teams from our program in other age divisions there. That’s 48 kids plus one parent each for a total of 96 travelers R/T. We all flew SW because of the check bag policy. A hockey bag plus a stick bag each… obviously next season will shop for the best rates. We travelled to 6 tournaments this year. All on SWA. There are hundreds of travel hockey teams across the nation…who are about to change from exclusively Southwest to checking all their options. And that’s just one sport…baseball I know as large equipment bag so they’re going to start shopping too. Most of the tournaments are in cities where multiple airlines fly so I’m guessing a 30-40% loss of revenue just from sports teams.
2025-03-11 11:27,"They should go the other direction, charge people per carry on. Forcing people to check bags speeds up the boarding and disembarkation and takes away a lot of the bickering for boarding position. Combined with assigned seats, now who cares about seat or boarding? I was personally in favor of assigned carry on locations, each seat has a spot and if you don't use it, then it becomes free. People have been abusing the carry on size and amount for years, either assign it to the seat or charge for that. Why punish someone for actually checking bags in?"
2025-03-11 11:29,"Well, that was the reason I flew them. They go in the pile with the rest of the airlines, won't be my preferred. It was good while it lasted"
2025-03-11 11:47,Well Southwest just sealed the deal of my family no longer flying with them.
2025-03-11 12:04,"I have like 300,000 points I’ve been saving. Better use them now before they become worthless. Wouldn’t be surprised if all of a sudden they said those points are expired"
2025-03-11 12:53,Had to check the calendar because I legit was like “April 1st already?”
2025-03-11 13:38,"They fumbled badly. The free bag policy and open seating were the qualities that distinguished them in a competitive market, and now they both lost their edge and made customers angry, tarnishing their own reputation. I was about to buy their credit card but now I’ll go with United, which is more convenient for my travel, but I was going to sacrifice convenience for Southwest’s bag and seating benefits. Aside from the tangible benefits, these policies make flying with the airline feel like a more elevated experience, less stress and maybe the idea that they could care a little bit about their customers. But, what this story highlights overall is that no one is safe from corporate greed. Southwest, IMO, had the BEST reputation in the airline industry and because they want to increase their bottom line they are throwing it all away. I honestly want to boycott Southwest for being a sellout because I can’t stand the idea of them bailing everything they have stood for just to make more money in the end."
2025-03-11 14:01,"Fuck em. I’m done. Came here to rant. They been getting shittier and shittier over the years. The seat selection bullshit was the first straw and now no free bags is the final straw. They are NOT on the same level as Delta or American Airlines and while they are better than Spirit, Frontier, and Allegiant… I can no longer justify paying their prices for shit service. If they want to offer, no free bags and paid for seats/seat selection, then you have to lower your prices even further if they expect people to continue to support them. Otherwise, they’ll forever be an overprice budget airline."
2025-03-11 11:33,"If I have to pay to check bags I'm just going to switch back to Allegiant. Cheaper tickets, non stop flights. Sure the seats don't recline but I'm fine with that lol"
2025-03-11 11:53,Just another airline now. RIP Southwest. Hope anyone w many miles or credits gets to use them before May!
2025-03-11 11:59,"A sad day for Southwest. It’s now just like every other airline. My friends teased me about my loyalty to Southwest, but I almost always fly with at least one checked bag. They were always cheaper. 30 years. Well, thanks for the memories!"
2025-03-11 12:07,"Someone explained that the assigned seats were because the passengers wanted it, its to charge more money for seats….and now, i see that is true."
2025-03-11 13:53,"I don't fly often, but to me the only thing that really pushed me to Southwest most of the time was the free checked bags. I never used 2 individually but would usually check one so I didn't have to lug it around the airports. Lately I've been booking with Delta because even with checked bag fees, their fares typically were lower to the destinations I was flying compared to southwest. Sad to see them change this policy."
2025-03-11 14:41,Herb Kelleher would never.
2025-03-11 14:45,"They wrote this email like it's a BENEFIT to us, lol."
2025-03-11 15:38,"In December 2024, they sent an email saying ""Our heart is here to stay"" citing that bags fly free, no change/cancellation fees, and no flight credit expiration. All 3 are no longer true."
2025-03-11 15:57,Herb Kellerher is turning over in his grave. The airline he created on his bar napkin just crashed and burned.
2025-03-11 11:41,Literally no reason to stick with southwest now. I previously would not fly with anyone else. In the last 6 months I have canceled all my SW credit cards. im done.
2025-03-11 11:43,With all the people jumping ship I should have plenty of room to spend out on upcoming flights. Actually they are likely to start cutting flights and charging more. Ok I'm going with the rest of you.
2025-03-11 13:12,"You'll notice they rolled out multiple anti-passenger changes at the same time: * Paid checked bags * Flight credit expiration * Lower earn ratio on rapid reward points * No more free changes on Basic (though oddly you can still cancel and get a flight credit, so the key difference here is inconvenience) I'm going to bet the checked bags portion of this was the preplanned ""we heard you"" piece that can be easily carved out while they keep all the rest of the changes. Then they'll reintroduce the checked bag change later and there won't be nearly as much furor as the outrage was already spent once on this issue."
2025-03-11 13:51,"The bag policy is annoying but honestly it's workable (get a CC that will probably allow bags or just do a carry on). The nonrefundable aspect for the first two tiers is the worst. at any given time I have 8 SW flights in my account and end up taking four of them. (no I don't cancel the last minute or have four flights home in the same trip; they are all ones I am planning on taking or at least trying to convince my wife). If I'm not able to have flexibility like that, I'm going either to another point program with cancellations or im just booking cheapest last minute....and that probably isn't SW"
2025-03-11 14:00,I hope they see this thread a realize people are going to fly other airlines. The bags fly feee is what keeps me coming back to SW. without there’s no reason to fly them.
2025-03-11 14:00,Honestly thought they’d drop to one bag and ease us into this over time. Might not even be worth spending the little flight credit we have with them now depending on the fees. End of an era for us.
2025-03-11 14:00,"Well, it was a great run of 20+ years. There is now zero reason to fly SWA again. I’ll be burning the remainder of my points and probably closing my SWA Priorty Visa too."
2025-03-11 14:42,I blame every idiot who pushed for assigned seating. They pushed one domino over and thought that the rest wouldn’t fall.
2025-03-11 14:44,Does anyone know if same day flight change A-List benefit will still apply to basic economy fares?
2025-03-11 16:04,"To everyone reading this, please, please, PLEASE [email them](https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us) so our complaints take over their daily operations. Spam their channels, be resilient, don’t give up. Make your voices so heard that they have no choice but to listen. And above all, remember, we vote with our dollars."
2025-03-11 16:19,The entire rollout seems half-baked. They don’t tell us how much bags will cost and they don’t breakdown details for a-list/a-list preferred (ie will others booked under us receive free bags). I don’t trust Southwest’s messaging anymore.
2025-03-11 19:45,"I don't have numbers on this, just going by experience. But operationally, it seemed like the free checked bags helped board faster (not as much fighting over overhead space, gate checking etc), which allowed Southwest to turn around their planes very quickly (a hallmark of southwest's operational efficiency)."
2025-03-11 11:46,"""Southwest will now charge to breathe on plane"""
2025-03-11 12:01,Does the two free bags for ALP apply to those flying with them on the same confirmation number?
2025-03-11 12:02,This shit becoming Spirit
2025-03-11 12:11,Just got my email with all the changes. Should have been titled “Roadmap to customer reduction and lost revenue”
2025-03-11 12:22,I just wanna say I called this days ago. The changes are even worse than I predicted but not far off. The worst part is the changes to rapid rewards redemption value.
2025-03-11 12:26,"I have some points to use up before switching airlines, If I book flights for Sept before the bag charges start end of May would my bags still be free?"
2025-03-11 12:31,This was literally their slogan.
2025-03-11 12:38,"How are people reading ""one free bag for credit card holders"" - one bag per card, or one bag per ticket purchased with said card? Also... This has triggered us to start looking into other loyalty programs. We may not jump ship right away (companion pass, no change fees), but I expect other perks to go away soon and we have no reason to stick with this airline vs any other at that point."
2025-03-11 12:40,I dumped all my SW stock. Will never fly them again.
2025-03-11 12:44,"WN was different and better. Now it's one more of the group. My travel frequency won't change, but my money will now be spread between multiple airlines rather than 90% going to WN. I would often fly with a connection to stay with WN over a direct flight with another airline. I hate it when corporate makes a great product worse than before."
2025-03-11 12:47,Cancelling my credit card today!
2025-03-11 13:00,I guess I’ll just have to accept spending time in Atlanta anytime I fly now because free bags and not laying over in Atlanta was basically the only reason I still flew southwest over delta.
2025-03-11 13:05,"“We’ll boost profits!” My guy, the free bags is WHY WE FLEW WITH YOU."
2025-03-11 13:09,"I’m not surprised….as soon as I saw the investment company taking c-suit seats, I knew free checked bags would be kaput. Seatings already been changed to increase fares with less seat pit on most (some newer jets are excluded), so the next thing will be charging for carry-on. My bet is profits will go up in the short term, but on the long term….they will be like every other airline and declare bankruptcy once per decade. Honestly i’m contemplating if I want to fly southwest anymore….its turning into a LCC with the same ticket prices of a major….why not fly the major and have a shorter travel time?"
2025-03-11 13:26,"I won't say 'so long and thanks for all the fish', but I'm thinking it loudly. the free checked bags was the primary reason I'd got southwest, And we (my family) didn't even always use them fully. ""free checked bags"" was a commitment to the customer: 'we know you may need extra space, and your may be happy with just a checked bag, but here's our promise. what you pay here is a flat rate. no microtransactions, no nickel-and-diming you. you're a customer, not our cash cow. fly with us and we'll take care of you for the price of your booking."" That's the promise we are told we'll lose today. southwest is telling its customers that their loyalty is worth less than their money and that following the crowd is worth more than excellence. They may still be able to earn my business in the future, but I've purchased flights from southwest nearly exclusively for 20 years due to their no hassle policies, and often at a higher price point than other airlines, just because that peace of mind is worth the cost. the days of checking their flights first, paying more for their tickets, and giving them preference in my spending practices are gone. Now, not only will they need to give me a better price, but I'll have to believe that booking with them is worth ignoring my sense of betrayal. Perhaps I'll see you around, southwest. perhaps not. it was fun while it lasted."
2025-03-11 13:45,"I just have to add to what everyone else is saying—this is so frustrating. As a middle-class family of four, we've relied on Southwest for years to make travel and new experiences possible within our budget. We've carefully accumulated points through the shopping portal—never a credit card—taking advantage of every available Southwest perk, including Costco gift cards. When you're on a budget, avoiding an extra $400 in baggage fees can make a huge difference—that's a rental car or a few meals at a restaurant in a new city. It’s disheartening to see yet another change that makes travel harder for the average family. That said, I recognize the privilege of traveling and the experiences I’ve been able to provide for my kids. But still—this one stings"
2025-03-11 14:03,"Well, there goes my only reason to fly south west. It was good while it lasted, but I will be moving onto a more premium airline that offers more for the price that they charge 🫡"
2025-03-11 14:03,"RIP SW. What a sad day. 😢 I mainly flew with SW bc of the two free checked bags, open seating, flight credits that didn’t expire, and their customer service. “I hate to say it, I hope I don’t sound ridiculous. I don’t know who this man is. I mean, he could be walking down the street, I wouldn’t know a thing. Sorry to this man.” Edit: Also, I preferred the old app interface before they updated it to this new mid-looking app."
2025-03-11 14:13,This is awful. 48% of my airport (ABQ) is Southwest. And we really aren’t close enough to other states or other airports. Plus we have a high low income population. New Mexico is going to be doing road trips for a while apparently.
2025-03-11 14:20,Just another lousy airline nickel & diming their customers like everybody else. No reason to stay loyal anymore. Very disappointing 😞
2025-03-11 14:30,"SW screwed up with assigned seating. Now they are like any other airline but with less comfortable seats. I was loyal to SW. The one thing they had going for them and they screwed up. SW had orderly boarding. All other airlines, passengers crowd around haphazardly, standing here and there, crowding the area in no order whatsoever. We all had to guess if someone was in line, or endlessley ask 'what group are you in?'. What did all the people who complained about no assigned seating with SW think would happen when SW got assigned seating? Prices were certainly NOT going to stay the same. I may have heard 3 time in my life from someone who didn't like the 'cattle call' way of boarding. That's 3 times in 50 years of flying SW. These people would rather jumble and crowed around the gate to board instead of line up orderly and decide for yourself where you want to sit. I'm so pissed."
2025-03-11 14:39,Best comment I saw was the Southwest is becoming like Spirit Airlines.
2025-03-11 14:44,"With their fares having increased up to 70% on some routes in the last year and then this, who would want to continue traveling with them?"
2025-03-11 15:16,Southwest is about to discover that FAFO applies to airlines as well.
2025-03-11 15:18,Where are the morons that were cheering for assigned seating? Where did you think it would go next?
2025-03-11 17:38,"I can’t believe this is happening. I love Southwest to the point that I annoy my friends and coworkers about it. I am in just disbelief they would pull back on *everything* that has made them great. Free checked bags, non-expiring flight credits, open seating, easy price adjustments…all gone. Today will forever be remembered as the day Southwest decided to off itself."
2025-03-11 19:53,Does this apply to tickets purchased before policy change?
2025-03-11 11:13,Please just answer one question for me are the current southwest points I’ve already accrued. Are they even worth less now that they did some big change with earning future companion points?
2025-03-11 11:32,And now I know why there were cc bonuses to get me to ALP (first time ever) and CC so easily last year compared to the prior 5. To “ease” the transition to commoditized crap.
2025-03-11 11:37,"Well, I'm glad my next flight on WN is in April, and it may be my last. I used up many of my points for that flight, I guess I'll be exploring other carriers."
2025-03-11 11:47,Wow - I’m stunned. Guess I shouldn’t be but I thought there’s no way they would do that
2025-03-11 11:55,"Meanwhile, half of this reddit is still defending this airline for whatever brain dead reason"
2025-03-11 11:58,Really the only time I fly is to see my family in Florida. It’s becoming cheaper to just make the two day drive.
2025-03-11 12:01,Anddd there it goes. I’ve been loyal to Southwest for a long time. They’ve now cut every reason to be other than the companion pass and I wouldn’t be surprised if that next to go. Disappointing
2025-03-11 12:23,"Here is the text of the email they sent out: Today we announced updates to some of our policies and benefits within our fare bundles. Sharing them with you is important to us, as we’re working to offer you more choices to create travel experiences that fit your needs. Updates to Checked Baggage Policy We will offer two free checked bags to Rapid Rewards® A-List Preferred Members and Customers traveling on Business Select fares. We will also offer one free checked bag to A-List Members and other select Customers. In addition, Southwest will credit one checked bag for Rapid Rewards Credit Cardmembers. All remaining Customers will pay to check their first and second bags, and we will continue to charge for the third and fourth checked bags. Changes will apply to flights booked on or after May 28. Updates to Our Fare Bundles We’re updating the benefits of our fares bundles in phases. Whether you’re looking for a lower price with fewer perks, or more benefits for added flexibility, you’ll have the choice to pick what works best for your trip. Phase 1: Beginning this month, we increased our Rapid Rewards earn ratio on our Business Select fares and lowered the earn ratio on our Wanna Get Away® and Wanna Get Away Plus™ fares. We will also begin to vary our redemption rates across our fare products on some high- and low-demand travel periods. Phase 2: Beginning May 28, we will introduce a new Basic fare. This new Basic fare will be our lowest price point and will have less flexibility than other fares. Additionally, we will be adding expiration dates to our Flight Credits, which will vary based on which fare you choose to purchase. We recognize these changes may be a disappointment to some, but know we’re committed to building a Southwest that will continue to offer you low fares, convenient flights to destinations you want, and a travel experience that is rewarding. You can count on the Heart of Southwest, our People, to guide you through the changes and welcome you on your next journey with their friendly, award-winning Customer Service. With appreciation, Bob Jordan Bob Jordan President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board"
2025-03-11 12:29,No reason to stay loyal to SW because of this. Pathetic.
2025-03-11 12:45,"From article: Last year, it said while charging for bags could bring in $1.5 billion in additional revenue every year, it would cost the airline $1.8 billion in lost market share. they are right. I moved to Delta. At least I don’t feel like I am fly Greyhound anymore"
2025-03-11 12:49,There goes my only reason for staying with them. The prices kept going up and now this. It’s like Southwest doesn’t recognize their target market.
2025-03-11 12:49,"It's over. They want to be like the big 3, but they have no long haul routes, no screens in seats, no lounge access for people with status and no first class. What's the point? Point to point route structure giving you more non stops is the only advantage for those living in medium sized cities. For those in small markets you never had sw anyway. For those in large markets, you're going to stick with your hub and spoke major airline. Poor Southwest. An activist investor is going to kill you."
2025-03-11 12:52,"Wow what a bait and switch from the original announcement last year assuring us free bags weren’t going anywhere….if I wasn’t A-list and flights weren’t so convenient for me, I would be switching."
2025-03-11 13:02,I said that once they lift this I’m closing my credit card and not coming back. Goodbye Southwest.
2025-03-11 13:26,Yikes. Denver is my airport so I can luckily just fly united mostly anywhere but this is so lame. SW was often the more expensive option I would go with because free bags. Adding bag fees is going to turn a lot of customers towards other airlines.
2025-03-11 13:30,"Shocked by this. I always figured they’d bump it down from two free checked bags to one, which would have been frustrating, but whatever. At this point, why even bother flying Southwest? Given the amount of outrage we’re seeing thus far, I wonder if there’s a chance they walk this back? I remember something similar happened when Delta made some large scale changes to their FF program, and they walked back the changes once they saw how unpopular they were."
2025-03-11 13:46,"Was a loyal, *loyal* Southwest customer for years until they ruined Christmas with that system meltdown years ago and have not stepped foot on their planes since - but I at least could recognize I was being a bit ridiculous and just principled for principle sake. But now it’s not looking so silly - what’s the actual value prop of this airline anymore? It certainly isn’t the low cost fares…"
2025-03-11 13:53,"They are also adding a Basic tier (that will become the charge for a seat selection tier when they begin seat assignments), reduced the number of points you earn on flights (making it harder to achieve status), and flight credits now expire after 12 months. After I no longer have companion (which is now harder to earn and maintain), I'm done with SW."
2025-03-11 14:02,"Two free checked bags was a nice bonus but it was never a deal breaker for me. I'm all about price and service. But, as many people have posted, SWA is now just another airline. So with that said, rather than defaulting to booking my flights on Southwest, I explore ALL airlines available to me. Honestly, that goes against everything taught in Marketing 101—don't drive your loyal customers towards your competition. Doing so is a recipe for disaster."
2025-03-11 14:10,It is amazing how short sighted executives are. Executives make typical short sighted decisions Company loses money Stock price declines Layoff employees Executives receive bonuses
2025-03-11 14:11,"Literally no reason to fly this once-great airline now. None. Still angry for making me and my teenage daughter sleep overnight on a bench in Hobby after they canceled a connection and offered no compensation, voucher, or hotel. Free bags and nostalgia was literally the only reason I would risk flying this airline again. Now - no freaking way."
2025-03-11 14:13,They will now go back in the shuffle - I’ll simply fly with whoever is the cheapest for the amount of bags and people flying - that’s it. No more loyalty of any kind.
2025-03-11 14:18,"I have flown nothing but SW for the last 15 years. If they are going to go down the same route other airlines do, I will have no incentive to fly exclusively with SW."
2025-03-11 14:28,"well… i was waiting to buy southwest thanksgiving tickets. looking at other airlines, the prices are already in the $600 range. this sucks 😭"
2025-03-11 14:33,"Damn I've never even checked other airlines prices in years. Now they are no different than anyone else. I cannot possibly understand how they see this as a good move. Who is being brought TO Southwest by these changes, to make up for all of us leaving?"
2025-03-11 14:54,"Got that dreaded email this morning. Fuck us “basic” folk, amirite?"
2025-03-11 15:02,"Ugh. They are pretty much the only carrier at my very-convenient local airport LGB and I’ve been loyal for a long time. Guess I’ll have to go to LAX or SNA now, at least I’ll get a nonstop on another airline"
2025-03-11 15:13,The only reason to fly with Southwest these days is to make the airport experience easier in some cities
2025-03-11 15:17,Bob’s saving himself has gutted SWA the company.
2025-03-11 15:21,"I rarely fly Southwest, but here's the exact scenario I (used to) always fly them: short, competitive, non-stop flights (e.g., SMF to LAX). If I book a few weeks in advance, the price will be $79 one-way on all of WN, DL, UA, etc. I would always choose WN because those are basic fares for DL and UA and I HATE how inflexible those are. So why the hell would I choose WN now, especially when I have status with DL? WN will never see another penny of mine"
2025-03-11 15:27,"Too bad. If they got rid of open seating but kept free checked bags, I think they would have had a pretty nice competitive advantage"
2025-03-11 15:27,"Airline loyalty really means nothing anymore. Delta found a way last year to screw skymiles customers, and southwest just ended the last major policy that kept customers loyal to them . It used to be that airlines would give you incentives to fly with them now not so much"
2025-03-11 15:35,"Man, this is disappointing. 11 year loyal traveler here. I overlooked a few things like partnering with Expedia, assigned seating, flight credit expiration, and their right leaning ways (yeah I know...). With the prices not being as competitive as they previously have, the limited amount of direct flights, and DFW Airport being 15 min closer to me than Love, I'm done. I was a target customer for them being in my 40s, single, no children, and a huge leisure traveler (about 10 times per year) with disposable income. I supported them during COVID (12 different cities) when others couldn't travel. There's literally NO reason to keep using them. I hope that the other airlines take note and go after the deflectors hard and fast to win us over. It would literally take offering one free checked bag on their economy rates to do it."
2025-03-11 15:45,I guess they don't understand their customers.
2025-03-11 16:05,"What they should be doing is charging for carry on. Remove the over head bins, and what you bring on must fit under the seat. Would definitely speed up the boarding process."
2025-03-11 16:12,"First the open seating, and now this? Sigh. I don't fly often, few times a year, but always chose SW when possible. Now there's no reason to prefer them. I'm sad."
2025-03-11 16:14,The very least they could have done was have this coincide with assigned seats. I can only image how many more preboards there are gonna be now.
2025-03-11 16:14,"Hope this absolutely flops. I have shared feedback here and on their website and will absolutely have NO loyatly to SW anymore. It was the months of promising this big perk staying when I knew that Bob Jordan was going to totally mess with the SW brand since he was brought on. So disappointing. Such a shame. BOO, Southwest!!!"
2025-03-11 16:14,"Email Southwest your discontent. Maybe they'll flip like Trump - apply tariffs and watch the reaction, then take them off when the consequences are too hard to swallow."
2025-03-11 16:17,"If anyone from Southwest’s executive team read this board, you’d think they’d say “Wow. We’ve really made a mistake here.” In reality, they knew this is how we’d react. And much like this policy, they don’t give one single shit about any individual customer or long term customer loyalty. This was a business decision. They somehow determined this will be better for them to change their long-standing model. And they didn’t factor 97% of their customer base into that decision making process. All that aside, I think the main issue with this is that other customers are going to try a different airline for the first time. Lots of loyal SW travelers have only ever flown SW. Once they learn how to better navigate other airlines and better fares, Southwest will become one of many instead of the one and only. The group boarding and free bags made things EASY for people to book exclusively Southwest. Now those same people are going to be inconvenienced with higher prices and baggage fees, why stay loyal? I use to exclusively book with Southwest. Moving to Portland forced me to look into Alaska - especially their Hawaiian flights. I didn’t look outside of Southwest until I absolutely needed to because it was so convenient. I suppose EVERYONE feels that way now. I don’t love Alaska. But I absolutely love Hawaiian. (I hope Alaska doesn’t neuter them.) When SW travelers realize Hawaiian is the same price from any west coast port to any Hawaiian port, they’ll never step foot on a SW flight to Hawaii ever again. Needless to say, I hope it doesn’t work out for them."
2025-03-11 16:19,"Wow, waking up to this on my sleep-in day was a slap in the face. I have adored and faithfully used my Southwest credit card for years, but I'm cancelling it today. I encourage others who are upset by this policy (and have the means) to do the same. It feels so unbelievably stupid to specifically send us multiple emails about the fact that they'd *never* change the bag fees, and then less than four months later, boom. And the seating changes are for '26 (for now......) but this starts in two months. Southwest has always been my favourite airline but it's American and Delta for me now, I guess! Goodness, I'm genuinely so sad. I loved flying Southwest so much."
2025-03-11 16:20,Fuck hedge funds and the billionaires running them
2025-03-11 16:22,"I REALLY REALLY doubt it. But on the off chance they are compensating for the free bags by making each flight segment like $40 cheaper (presuming that is what they will charge per checked bag), would that be worth it to some of you?"
2025-03-11 16:24,"Well, that's one way to burn whatever was left of their brand loyalty"
2025-03-11 16:24,"Dear Southwest Airlines, Oh, how the mighty have fallen. It is with a heavy yet utterly unimpressed heart that I pen this farewell, mourning the loss of an airline that once stood for something greater than bottom-line greed and soulless investor appeasement. You used to be the airline of the people. You were the underdog that laughed in the face of checked bag fees, flipped the bird to stuffy corporate policies, and made flying fun—or at least tolerable—with your no-nonsense transparency and quirky charm. But now? Now, you’re just another corporate sellout desperately cosplaying as the airline you used to be, hoping no one notices the sheer hypocrisy wafting from your overpriced drink carts. First, you gutted your Rapid Rewards program overnight, like a thief in the night, snatching away the value of points that loyal customers—myself included—spent years accumulating. No warning, no remorse, just a “whoops, sucks to be you” shrug from corporate. Then, you dared to toy with the sacred cow: Two. Bags. Fly. Free. Oh, Southwest, how did we get here? Was the money from your beloved minority investor (less than 50% ownership, but apparently 100% control) just too delicious to resist? Did they dangle a few shiny stock options in front of you and make you forget everything you once stood for? For 54 years, you built something special—a brand that meant something. A brand that made people loyal, not because they had to be, but because they wanted to be. And now, you’ve traded it all for the hollow pursuit of squeezing a few extra bucks out of passengers who already had your backs. Well, guess what? You no longer have mine. Since loyalty no longer means anything to you, it no longer means anything to me. So, I bid you farewell, not with sadness, but with the kind of cathartic joy that comes from finally dumping a toxic ex who didn’t know what they had until it was gone. From now on, my airline loyalty is dead—just like the Southwest I once knew and loved. I’ll be flying with whoever has the cheapest ticket and still lets me check a damn bag. Enjoy your newfound soulless existence. May your investors be happy, because your passengers sure as hell won’t be. Not-so-lovingly, A Formerly Loyal Passenger"
2025-03-11 16:29,"Imagine thoroughly dismantling a loved and trusted brand like this, in a matter of months. Truly a perfect representation of everything that is wrong with capitalism and the relentless extraction of brand value and customer service in the name of shareholder “value”."
2025-03-11 16:31,File a complaint here: https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us Maybe if enough complain they will back track.
2025-03-11 16:40,There goes Love Field traffic
2025-03-11 16:44,This is capitalism. You can never just accept a business model as is bc it works. You always have to be thinking of how to make yet more money.
2025-03-11 16:49,This was one of the few reasons I would fly southwest. Looks like I’m going to try and use up remaining points and find another airline. Flights are expensive enough aside from being nickel and dimed for things like checked bags
2025-03-11 16:51,"I'm actually so mad about this that I sent an email. It took a minute to find, but if you go here: [https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us](https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us) then go Complaint > Baggage > Policy and Procedures I think that's the most fitting."
2025-03-11 16:55,The two things that always made me prefer southwest were their seating policy and their checked bags policy.
2025-03-11 17:03,Capitalism at its finest 😎
2025-03-11 17:09,"Southwest is like the only competition to Hawaiian for inter-island Hawaii flights since they started a few years ago. They kept ticket prices lower than the monopoly, but oddly their prices are now the same or HIGHER than Hawaiian. Without the free bags policy, there’s literally no reason to fly them over Hawaiian inter-island, as Hawaiian (now owned by Alaska) is such a better flying experience. I wonder how long Southwest will survive in Hawaii now."
2025-03-11 17:11,Knew it would happen. Knew it the day they got rid of free seating
2025-03-11 17:11,"When everyone was celebrating the end of open seating and denied that it was the harbinger of nickel and diming to come—- hahahaha, how’s it taste? Soon enough they’ll charge for carry ons and we’ll really be scraping the bottom!"
2025-03-11 17:13,There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding about why people fly Southwest.
2025-03-11 17:21,"Southwest: "" Waaaaah we need more money"" Also Southwest: ""Record fourth quarter and record full year operating revenues, excluding special items, of $7.0 billion and $27.6 billion, respectively"" ""Southwest Airlines annual gross profit for 2024 was $6.116B, a 6.46% increase from 2023."""
2025-03-11 17:21,"So, they are doing away with how they seat people & bags fly free. Why fly southwest? What other things do they have that sets them apart?"
2025-03-11 17:25,"I’m from Fort Worth and before would go out of my way to fly with Southwest out of Love Field, but after these changes they’ve done there’s really no point in doing so anymore. Such a shame. I love flying out of Love Field!"
2025-03-11 17:38,"All they had to do was enforce their policies and prevent the jetway jesus but they choose this route instead. I'm ALP, I'll get a status match with United. United flies more flights out of Denver than SWA does, plus it has lounges. I don't know WTF SWA thinks they're doing, I'm done with them."
2025-03-11 17:42,Elliot strikes again. Private Equity will destroy every company in this Country.
2025-03-11 17:48,Did anyone else catch that they contradict themselves in their own email? In the body it says free bags for flights booked on or before 5/28 but in the fine print at the bottom it says for flights traveled on or before 5/28. Which is it??
2025-03-11 17:49,Tried to warn people. They applauded open seating. Sometimes you gotta stand your ground when they try to slowly destroy what you love.
2025-03-11 17:50,Oh great. Now even more assh0les are going to be cramming their too-large cases into all the overhead bins. Awesome
2025-03-11 17:52,"Fuck investment firms. There isn’t a single business that has benefited from their involvement. It’s nothing more than blood sucking billionaires who suck a company dry until it’s completely dead, and then move on to the next one. Absolutely shameful that we live in a society that allows this."
2025-03-11 18:03,"I’m confused by this. Does this mean if I book a flight before May 28th the bags will still be free, even if the flight isn’t until later in the year? We’re flying to Disney in September and I’m so disappointed about this change since paying for bags for a family is pricey. I’m considering buying tickets soon if it will save on the bag fee!"
2025-03-11 18:22,Anybody have any good credit card referral offers for another airline? I’ll run out the companion pass this year then move on.
2025-03-11 18:38,"I’ve been a Southwest credit card holder for a decade now. I’ve loved the perks and points but I’m canceling before my annual fee hits next month. I’ll pay baggage fees to a more “uppity” airline like Delta, American, United etc. before handing over more money to Southwest."
2025-03-11 18:45,Fuck Elliott Management. RIP Southwest.
2025-03-11 18:56,Capitalism strikes again
2025-03-11 18:58,"Back in September, a flight I was on was overbooked and I opted to get a different flight for a $1200 voucher. I still have a good chuck of it remaining that I need to use before it expires in the fall. Very much annoyed that now I have to use them and pay for checked bags. Once I use them, I may not fly WN again."
2025-03-11 19:00,I literally just booked a flight with them 2 days ago. It's still listed as free bags. I wonder if they will uphold that or try to charge us at check in.
2025-03-11 19:02,SWA was such a great alternative to the expensive airlines. Now they're as expensive and offer less.
2025-03-11 19:03,The overhead bins already fill up so quickly! I check my bag and my carryon fits under the seat in front of me. I cannot see this going well.
2025-03-11 19:08,I have many times chosen Southwest not because it was cheaper but because it was less complicated. Now everyone sucks. So there’s no reason to choose Southwest over anyone else. What kind of analytics could they possibly have that tells them this is the way forward?
2025-03-11 19:10,"Only ever flew southwest, won’t be now. Absolutely ridiculous"
2025-03-11 19:19,"What reason is there to be loyal to SW. tickets often were a little higher than legacy airlines. We know they won’t lower the fares, but the bag fees on top will mean other airlines will be cheaper. Great job Elliott, look at the bottom line so focused you screw up a working business model. Jackass"
2025-03-11 19:21,"And now I have no reason to fly Southwest. So long, and thanks for all the fish!"
2025-03-11 19:23,That was the only reason why people would book on Southwest other than that all the other airlines charge half price
2025-03-11 19:34,"So I already have tickets purchased for after that date. At the time I bought them it said ""two free checked bags"". Will they honor that?"
2025-03-11 19:39,Glad I decided to switch away from my SW credit card last year to one I can use points for different airlines
2025-03-11 19:39,Penny wise pound foolish
2025-03-11 19:41,What is Southwest's value proposition now?? Literally no reason to book them over the other airlines now. They are all the same.
2025-03-11 19:44,Enshittification
2025-03-11 19:52,"Family motto used to be: If Southwest doesn’t go there, we don’t either.” Now it’s becoming: “Who else goes there?”"
2025-03-11 19:55,Their bag policy is literally the only reason why I fly them most of the time. I have a flight next week on them and I’m guessing it will be my last.
2025-03-11 19:57,"The free bag policy resulted in fewer carry-ons which resukted in faster boarding/disembarking. Open seating also contributed to faster boarding. these changes will result in fewer flights able to take off on time and more delays, which with SW’s tight layovers, will mean more missed connections. yes, long term this is a disaster for Southwest."
2025-03-11 20:08,can i fly with 2 bags free if i book my December flights before may? since they said changes will take place may 28
2025-03-11 20:09,The only saving grace for them right now is direct flights from my home airport to places that I want to go. All others have layovers. That's it. Really sad how things have gone. We have just witnessed the rapid implosion of a once thriving company.
2025-03-11 20:12,"as a former employee of SWA who saw the writing on the wall early last year, selling out to private equity was one of the main contributing factors to my stepping away from the company."
2025-03-11 20:13,"Even with the current 2 free checked bags, I see some huge roller bags getting dragged onboard. Can’t even imagine what it will be like once they start charging."
2025-03-11 20:44,isn't this like 'how to get your company purchased in 7 easy steps?' This is a bid to tank the value of the company and sell it IMO.
2025-03-11 21:01,"So with all these changes, Southwest will be like every other legacy airline, except without business class seats and a large international network?"
2025-03-11 21:42,"I just now cancelled several flights I have booked for the rest of this year. Why? As an A-List flyer, I now have to look at other options for my frequent flights. And guess what... Southwest is now just like Delta... WITHOUT the Sky Club perks. I suggest that all SW frequent flyers take a look at airlines with airport hospitality rooms. I hate to leave SW... always good people... but SW has lost its brand identity."
2025-03-11 22:04,"I tend to pack light, so charging for bags doesn't overly bother me, but changing the flight credits so they expire is really whack. Being able to easily change my flight and have flight credit was the main reason I chose Southwest over other airlines. It just feels so greedy. Maybe implement one cost cutting strategy but removing all the perks is crazy... pure greed"
2025-03-11 22:06,The ONLY reason I booked SW for our trip this month over another airline due to the free checked bags. Now I will likely never fly SW again because what’s the incentive? What a dumb move.
2025-03-11 22:34,"I am livid. Been flying with SW since '70's. They finally sold out. It's downhill from here. New CEO = GREED. Just like USAA, run it into the ground. Are there any decent companies left in this country?"
2025-03-11 22:34,"Southwest has been my preferred airline for years, due to open seating with priority boarding for families and no baggage fees. If I am stuck with all those different fees, will choose a better airline."
2025-03-11 22:40,"Oh well, I didn't want to drive 45 minutes to Hobby when I can drive 10 minutes to IAH...private equity just trying to sell assets and dump debt!"
2025-03-11 22:46,This is the only reason why the overhead bins don’t get full.
2025-03-12 00:00,An Era died today 🙁
2025-03-12 00:34,I don’t really like southwest . They only a step above spirit and frontier because of the free bags thing but now 💀
2025-03-12 01:01,They gonna tank so hard. I bet they bring it back
2025-03-12 01:15,"Not only will I choose another airline for my domestic flights (8-10 per year), I will no longer be using my Southwest Rapid Rewards credit card. I do about $65K a year on that card for my business, but what's the 'point' when my points will no longer roll over to the next year? Did you know they changed THAT, too? And, I've never even made A-List. Screw 'em. I'm sick of companies kissing stockholder ass."
2025-03-12 01:50,"Jordan thinks this will encourage people, on the eve of a massive economic hurricane about make landfall on this country, to sign up for their co-branded credit card? Are they fucking stupid? This is so sad on so many levels. SWA has been like an old family friend throughout the years. I grew up flying on them, did all of my flights during my apprenticeship with them (like six times a year), and my wife and I fly them exclusively for all of our vacation and travel needs. Private equity FUCKS everything up. Constantly. Dammit! Guess I’ll be heading over to Delta or United."
2025-03-12 01:54,"honestly, f them. I will boycott them now. I understand all airlines nickel and dime us to death and do not care about us, but I'm so angry at Southwest for doing this that I would rather fly another airline. There's nothing that differentiates Southwest now. I'd rather boycott and maybe bring them down than fly them now. This is a huge betrayal. I hope they end up going out of business."
2025-03-12 01:59,"I told my sister-in-law last year in July when it surfaced that they would begin nickel and diming for small things that ""bags fly free"" would be coming to an end. She vociferously defended SW because she did some research paper for her Marketing degree on them. Saying that ""it was core to their philosophy"" and that they'd never remove the promotion. I told her just give it time and the new shitheel of a CEO will make it go away in efforts to increase revenue. Sure enough, planned for less than a year later, it's set to happen."
2025-03-12 02:48,"I’ve flown Southwest exclusively for a couple decades, because of free baggage and points not expiring. I just booked a flight for September, before hearing about the changes. Had i known I would have used my rapid reward points before they expire. Sadly, this is the end of the road for me with SW. There is no draw to use them. The airline with the lowest price wins my purchase going forward."
2025-03-12 03:08,"Southwest could literally charge $1 for one bag, $2 for 2 bags, and $10 for oversized bags, and make millions a year from that."
2025-03-12 03:15,There’s no reason for me to fly SWA anymore Alaska airlines is the main airline at my home airport and they go anywhere I want to go with no transfers. I’m aware they charge for bags. But they’re local and even with bag fees they’re still usually cheaper
2025-03-12 03:30,Whoever made this decision is a complete moron. How to sink a company 101
2025-03-12 03:59,I definitely won't be flying exclusively Southwest anymore
2025-03-12 04:38,Did anyone else see that ridiculous chart they put in the email this morning? If I have to read a chart like that in order to book a flight on Southwest....then I'm booking Spirit or layovering with American
2025-03-12 14:25,Like I’d fly with the current administration
2025-03-12 14:27,~~We do things a little different~~ We're just like everyone else.
2025-03-11 12:03,If I ran a competitor I’d institute a free first bag policy specifically on flights to Orlando and Las Vegas.
2025-03-11 11:18,No doubt. And highlighting the other perks
2025-03-11 11:30,Exactly. If I were them I would figure out a good status match offer
2025-03-11 11:46,"Yep. My home airport (MKE) is 39% Southwest and 18% Delta not including regional partners. If I were Delta, I’d do a massive ad buy highlighting them vs Southwest to capture the defectors."
2025-03-11 12:10,They should be adding routes. The “Southwest effect” is dead.
2025-03-11 12:16,Southwest reduced capacity at Denver so literally the narrative writes itself
2025-03-11 13:48,"Delta and United are going to get bigger, and this is a huge lifeline for the premium Spirit options. Why fly SWA when you can fly “1st class” on Spirit that has all the old SWA perks + some."
2025-03-11 13:46,And eyeing the intra-California market.
2025-03-11 12:45,"If I were Delta, United, or American, I'd be introducing a ""free bag"" program."
2025-03-11 11:49,Don't worry. Charging for carry-ons will be coming soon.
2025-03-11 11:30,The people in line that already have 4 bags for carry-on are going to become a bigger problem
2025-03-11 12:27,Exactly. It’ll be like a lot of other airlines where every passenger is doing their best work to avoid paying for checked bags. So SW will then end up gate checking a bunch of bags for free. I just cancelled my SW Chase card. I’ll be writing to my airport authority and encouraging them to find more passenger friendly carriers to bring into the airport. If I do need to fly SW going forward you find bet I’ll be stuffing it all in the overhead.
2025-03-11 12:08,"That was my immediate thought. Even now, with free checked luggage, overhead luggage is thunderdome."
2025-03-11 11:40,Will they still check bags in for free if the overhead gets full? If so I’ll just make them do it every time.
2025-03-11 10:48,It’s really disappointing to see this happen
2025-03-11 12:32,Seriously. No free bags. No free changes. Travel credits expire. It's just another airline now. And not even the cheapest or the most convenient. They never have directs anywhere or at good times
2025-03-11 12:18,"I was whole heartedly devout southwest, even with the changes made up until this one. Nail in the coffin. Might was well paint the planes yellow and call them spirit plus."
2025-03-11 13:23,I’m sure Herb Keleher is SPINNING in his grave. Guy was a masterclass in leadership. I met him in the mid 90’s when his book “Nuts!” Came out. His legacy was destroyed within five years of his death. Fuck PE.
2025-03-11 13:11,It all went downhill once they stopped handing out honey roasted peanuts IMO
2025-03-11 13:04,I literally fly with them bc they don't charge for bags. & I NEVER check bags. It was the fact that they cared to appreciate the consumers. At this point we all should just fly Spirit since all the Airlines are charging &&&& the flight prices are still high AF
2025-03-11 11:54,"Yep, literally was the last pro to flying Southwest"
2025-03-11 13:39,"This was their differentiator. Unfortunate, I think they will quickly regret this decision. Market share will def be impacted."
2025-03-11 13:37,"Hijacking’s top comment with article info: Under the new policy, the airline will continue to offer two free checked bags to loyal customers with the highest status, A-List Preferred, and passengers who pay the most premium fares. Customers with lower loyalty status, A-List, will get one free checked bag. The carrier will credit one checked bag for passengers who hold its co-branded credit card. Those who do not qualify for its free bag options will be charged for their first and second checked bags."
2025-03-11 15:39,"As soon as I read a hedge fund manager was involved in the decision, it all made sense. I can’t see SW going anywhere but downhill from now."
2025-03-11 13:44,Our family of 4 just came back from Florida vacation on SW. We debated the 12 hour drive vs flying.. one main reason we flew was the free bags! I guess next time we do drive..
2025-03-11 14:14,"Yup, I had decided I was done with Southwest with the seating changes. Now there is literally no difference between Southwest and other airlines. Delta gets my loyalty now."
2025-03-11 17:51,"The worst part about this for me is when they originally announced assigned seating WN was all over the media saying “don’t worry, we’re still the same loving caring company, and these are just minor changes coming in the next few months.” Alas, here we are months later and none of these changes are “minor”."
2025-03-11 22:08,"I wonder if this might be the start of the end of the company. Those free bags were the tag line for the company that everyone knew & counted on. Now only the business class & A listers get them? Those are two groups that don't need them. With all these changes, what is special about flying SWA now? Honestly can't think of a thing."
2025-03-11 11:25,Fire the smartest person in the room because they tell you the reality you don't want to hear. No wonder most board meetings are sycophant rubberstamping sessions.
2025-03-11 11:09,Loyal since 2011. That was the last straw.
2025-03-11 12:21,Yup. My last flight with SW is next week and I booked my next flight on American. No point in sticking around when by the end of 2025 SW will be another Spirit and Frontier. Not to mention their flights are the cost as flying any of the big 3.
2025-03-11 11:26,"If you're within 30 days of the fee, ask for a refund and cancel"
2025-03-11 11:34,They can sometimes give a prorated refund if you ask
2025-03-11 11:54,I heard credit card holders still receive one free bag
2025-03-11 12:29,"Yeah between this and ending open seating, there's nothing left differentiating them from any other budget airline. No reason at all to prefer them anymore."
2025-03-11 12:40,"I have converted 3 friends to SW the last 3 years as we have expanded our golf trips and bags fly free made it the reason we did. We just booked 9 tickets on SW for spring break at the end of this month as well. Southwest is about to FAFO they dont get the luxury flier or the poorest flier, they have the middle class flyer, and I can afford other airlines."
2025-03-11 13:27,Echoing this. Just look at Target. Most their marketing was surrounded around diversity and welp...their taking a hit.
2025-03-11 14:15,It’s like the $5 foot long at subway. You can’t advertise that for years and then change. And Southwest has been advertising free bags MUCH longer than Subway advertised $5 foot longs.
2025-03-11 11:35,"For a lot of smaller airports, they are the only nonstop. But, for me for work travel to Houston, I’ve always chosen Southwest over United cause of better earning toward companion pass and more use for personal travel. Now, I’ll probably pick United for work travel to Houston in the future as my work won’t require me to pick basic economy on United but will require Wanna Get Away on Southwest (as long as they continue to allow free changes/flight credits)."
2025-03-11 11:24,"Same reason why I pick any flight, it's the cheapest. Loyalty only benefits business travelers who are flying dozens of times per year."
2025-03-11 14:05,Yeah and I feel for all the FAs who will be on the front lines of pissed off customers who become aware of the change at the airport.
2025-03-11 13:29,"First adding paid assigned seating. Now getting rid of free checked-in bags. Upending the 2 biggest things that made Southwest what it was. Fuck Elliot Management. And they just ruined the flight credit policy too. Turned Southwest into another nickel-and-dime airline. Southwest has a worse hard product than the other main airlines, the whole reason people fly Southwest is because of the bag policy and because they like the old seating policy (no matter what that fake survey they released claimed). Fuck Elliot Management."
2025-03-11 14:11,This is all such bullshit man. It’s like every last thing in our lives that benefit us is just disappearing because of these bloodsucking monsters that make every last decision based on a number going up. And they expect me to feel sad when a CEO gets sh*t.
2025-03-11 13:28,"I mean the moment they announced assigned seating, there were a lot of people on these forums calling it out. People praised a bad decision that keeps getting worse. This is the new spirit or frontier."
2025-03-11 11:20,It’s basically the only perk left and it’s a big one. I’m sure it’s gone soon…
2025-03-11 11:29,"This is what would really impact my flying behavior. We fly carry on only and my husband is a wheelchair user so all this has minimal impact for me (accessibility line will still get him and aisle seat, and I don’t care whether we sit together). The recent change to Wanna Get Away points earning makes Companion Pass through flying a waste of energy, but the credit card route still works fairly well. Losing Companion Pass would drive me and my credit card spend elsewhere."
2025-03-11 12:31,"It'll probably just be devalued I'm guessing. They have been pushing the ""seasonal"" ones that are only able to be used in specific days/weeks. They're also changing how point redemptions and valuations work so it'll probably be shitty"
2025-03-11 11:07,"No problem, there's no other option at most SW hubs...oh wait...most of its bases overlap with United. Shit, if I'm getting United level service might as well just get the Star Alliance network"
2025-03-11 12:18,"Thanks for pointing out the CNBC article. Flight credits expire in one year (the way they did pre Covid) starting with tickets purchased 5/28. Also SW will launch a new basic economy fare at that point. I’d guess SW basic economy won’t have free changes. If the expiring flight credits work the same way as in the past, they create two problems. You can only have three forms of payment so if you have a number of credits from prices steadily dropping, you can’t use them all at once. The bigger issue is if you use a small flight credit to reduce the cost of a new flight, the earlier expiration date now applies to all of the funds"
2025-03-11 11:17,BWI here too. Definitely sucks it’s the only non stop option for most places. Definitely don’t wanna fly to CLT or ATL first on every trip. I have gradually watched the SW take over. I feel like we had much more delta mid 2010s 😭
2025-03-11 11:55,"Same. BWI. Direct flights 99% of time. And we have Companion Pass. I don’t check bags very often but with the reduce RR earnings on fares too, this is getting ridiculous."
2025-03-11 11:21,"Same. Although lately when looking at airfares, it hasn't been much of a savings to go on Southwest. If I was flying by myself I liked their COS policy but that and bags checked free were about it (and I expect the COS policy to go away too). The main flight I took was to Raleigh; my family member near there moved to Greensboro though so it's easier to fly to GSO than to RDU and rent a car."
2025-03-11 11:34,Same at MCO
2025-03-11 12:48,Similar situation here with HOU. This sucks.
2025-03-11 12:36,"BWI local here, but I live between BWI and DC. Over the last year, I’ve increasingly been flying AA out of DCA because I have EP status on AA. I also fly a lot to Seattle (Alaska out of BWI or DCA), Dallas (AA out of BWI), Orlando (AA out of DCA), Miami (AA out of BWI), and Chicago (AA out of BWI). The Florida destinations are still easier on Southwest given the number of flight options, but if Companion Pass goes, I think we’ll have to reevaluate."
2025-03-11 12:53,"For anything Southwest doesn't do direct you SHOULD switch honestly. The hub and spoke system is more resilient in bad weather. If it's direct then yeah, probably Southwest for you no matter the pride"
2025-03-11 12:52,"Same boat here. But honestly, Southwest prices and flight times have sucked enough recently that I've already been going to other airlines. Christmas flights to Denver were prohibitively expensive, so I flew Frontier. Flights to Charleston in a few months are terrible, so I'm driving to Dulles to fly United instead."
2025-03-11 12:54,Similar issue here in Chicago. I live in the south east suburbs. MDW is a 30 minute drive. ORD can be so busy it can be a 2hr drive. So now it’s a battle of spite.
2025-03-11 11:32,The article said SW Visa holders will get credited for checking 1 bag. Same perk- pay up front then get a statement credit for the amount
2025-03-11 12:20,It’s not free you have to pay the annual fee. Every airline does this with a cobranded credit card.
2025-03-11 13:16,Most consumers take the boot every time which is why everything is getting enshittified
2025-03-11 18:52,Such are the vulture capital firms. They consume and destroy to loot the remains and then move onto another company to do the same.
2025-03-11 11:33,"Well, their point to point model means their network can still collapse in a major storm....so there's that."
2025-03-11 13:07,Well now they're more expensive and have fewer options. What a deal!
2025-03-11 14:55,"SW just gave up on the SAN to PDX routes during Covid. I was hopeful they’d bring them back after the Terminal 1 expansion, but now I’m over it. I’m all in on Alaska, who has basically taken over for SW as the primary airline in SD."
2025-03-11 16:59,"My last SAN-PDX flight was cheaper on Alaska ***first class*** than Southwest Anytime before you factor in the fees SW is gonna impose... Alaska first class ain't all that, basically a more comfortable seat with booze, but it's > any Southwest experience. I don't even bother looking at SWA routes on the West Coast these days. They are not cost competitive. :("
2025-03-11 13:03,I was going to say “Pan Am says hi” but that took a couple decades to self destruct. Maybe TWA?
2025-03-11 11:12,"Especially if you are only WGA, i.e., basic economy! Management really screwed the goose here!"
2025-03-11 13:04,"I remember those comments , one assured me United would remove screens soon ( right after re installing them ) before southwest would get rid of free checked bags."
2025-03-11 14:35,"There were so many corporate book-lickers confidently saying, ""they'll never charge for bags."""
2025-03-11 17:13,"Same, so many fervent boot garglers who insisted it would never go so far."
2025-03-11 17:11,"That's a lot of added time just to save $40. IDK, I hate the fees too, but I'd have eaten it before SWA did this if I had a direct route option. Heck, I'd come out ahead b/c I wouldn't be spending money at an airport bar during the layover, lol."
2025-03-11 16:31,"Beautifully written. I'd add ""free"" to your last sentence int he first paragraph - specify that you refer to ""free checked bags will stay."" I 100% agree with you though."
2025-03-11 15:41,drove my Chevy to DFW-y and flew American instead
2025-03-11 12:58,Agree about how expensive Southwest has become. I remember looking for a flight from Las Vegas to BWI maybe 3 days out and the cheapest fares(Wanna Get Away) were almost $900. I mean that's absurd. Even a couple of years ago you could get a last minute fare from LAS to BWI for under $400. This company is now beyond greedy and they are gonna see imo a huge backlash and loss of lots of customers coming soon.
2025-03-11 13:02,"Same. I only fly for vacations 3-4 times a year, I don’t travel for work so I’ll never reach status"
2025-03-11 12:22,This has been a longstanding argument for all airlines. It makes the most sense so it won’t ever happen.
2025-03-11 12:26,And a link to their new fare breakdown: https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/article/policy-changes
2025-03-11 12:42,We only fly into orlando really with our kid. I will absolutely be at other airlines now. If an airline said “here’s a free bag per person” I’d shift in a heartbeat at this point 🤷🏻‍♂️
2025-03-11 12:11,They all have them now. American’s is paid. United and Delta have challenges that are easy to hit.
2025-03-11 12:13,"The problem Delta has out of Milwaukee is you have to connect to MSP or Detroit. If I’m flying to Orlando, I don’t want to connect so unless they start adding more direct routes, it’s not going to hit Southwest as hard as some may think."
2025-03-11 15:07,"This right here. The biggest reason I booked WN for an upcoming SJC-SNA trip is that adding an extra hour on each leg to get to SFO is extremely silly barring extreme price differentiation. But I'd have happily booked, say, AS and earned miles I can actually use -- if they flew the route."
2025-03-11 13:47,"They don’t have to offer anything. Every flight I take is full with a list of standbys. When you run at 90% capacity you don’t have to offer anything. In reality if you undercut SWA fares by $10, most people will switch."
2025-03-11 14:09,I'm guessing that Southwest will clamp down harder on that next.
2025-03-11 13:01,"That is partly the disappointing part for me. SW practically “owns” my airport (even building expansion/upgrade now 😐) so flights to destinations we go to on other airlines aren’t as easy. I always checked other carriers before reluctantly buying SW tickets due to the seating issue. Now, we get all of this & still not a lot of choice at BWI. I doubt they will drop SW (plus, God only knows the contract they are locked in with) and I don’t know if other airlines have the capacity to expand."
2025-03-11 11:42,"Yes, they will have to really. Like other airlines, there is no easy way to add a charge at this point."
2025-03-11 12:31,This is what every other airline deals with. If you want to check a bag on Delta that is carry on sized just bring it to the gate and it's free every time. The end result is that delta has planes on the ground longer. Assigned seats makes this even worse. I'd always read the percentage of times the southwest fleet spent in the air was the reason for their success. Now that southwest is the same as everyone else I will fly whomever is cheapest and has a non stop. Ski vacations just got $200 more expensive as well.
2025-03-11 11:38,after the sept earnings call didn’t we get an email that said “free bags are staying” in big font and bolded or did i make that up
2025-03-11 12:38,Travel credits expire? Is that new too? No free changes?
2025-03-11 12:51,"The shareholders literally complained that after they ended open seating, it was the #1 reason people switched off, even with free bags. So now they're ending free bags? They have literally no advantage over any airline now, except for business travel cause they still get free checked bags. Their stock is surging, but it's gonna be funny when their sales decline rapidly cause their economy fare has like a million restrictions it's crazy, and now you have to pay for a bag check?"
2025-03-11 13:06,"Unfortunately they are the dominant airline at my home airport (BNA Nashville) and often have the only direct flight somewhere I’m going, these changes suck extra because I’ll probably still end up using them begrudgingly 😕"
2025-03-11 21:34,When did this happen?
2025-03-11 21:35,"Exactly this. I have been a loyal SWA customer for years, primarily due to open seating, checked bags, and travel credits. I've endured ridicule from friends and family for my loyalty. Doing away with all of their signature services simply makes them a sub-par airline with outdated cabins and unreliable wifi. I live in a major city with my choice of airlines. Southwest has really screwed up and squandered the loyalty and good will of their base. Once they lose their base, who do they think they are attracting???"
2025-03-11 13:04,"Same here. Over the last several years we flew with Southwest exclusively. My companion pass just expired and now my family of 4 can get 1 checked bag (I still have the rapid rewards credit card), it’s just not worth it anymore. And now the basic fare travel credits expire after 6 months. Part of why we book with Southwest so often is because we knew if we had to cancel or change we could always just get a travel credit that wouldn’t expire. This is really, really disappointing."
2025-03-11 14:30,Same I was okay with the new seating thing they were doing but I love the open seating that was the number one reason why I flew with them and now the bags … and more bogus rules. I’m canceling my SW credit card and probably never flying with them anymore
2025-03-11 14:24,For me it was the yellow snack mix bags going away in favor of the nasty new pretzels. I loved those little ranch bagel bites.
2025-03-11 13:47,FACTS
2025-03-11 15:45,"God I miss those. I get the lawyers wanting to limit peanut allergy lawsuits, but damn they were tasty."
2025-03-11 13:36,"I also never check bags, but the free checked bags benefit all of us -- putting bags in the overhead was never quite the same Hunger Games as you get on the legacy carriers. This sucks, Southwest."
2025-03-11 13:49,I also hate the wording here. “Customers with highest status will continue to be treated right” “lower customers get nothing” like sorry povels
2025-03-11 14:12,It's unclear to me if cardholders get one credited bag per flight or one credit bag per year (similar to the 4 credits / year for upgraded boarding).
2025-03-11 11:42,"Private Equity Firms don't care about anything other than short term gains. They'll take everything they can get from a company, bankrupt it and move onto the next."
2025-03-11 14:27,"As someone deep in the corporate world these days. This happens A LOT. Then a message goes out saying ""So and so was a great VP, and is moving on to other things next months"" then you hear ""We are removing those who are roadblocks to our success"" Upper management regularly talks about removing these roadblocks so they can have their echo chamber. If you regularly present contrary analysis that goes against a c-suite/board initiative you will be removed. I've learned to be subtle, and mostly shut my trap."
2025-03-11 12:29,Sounds about right these days. Fall in line or get out.
2025-03-11 12:46,"Yep, the reality is the other senior leaders have to be puppets to keep their jobs. It is a cautionary tale."
2025-03-11 15:17,Loyal since 1997.
2025-03-11 12:54,Honestly spirit is probably gonna be the new southwest. They're cheap and the safety record is pristine.
2025-03-11 13:36,"It’s not clear from the above Reuters article, but the baggage fee is for flights *purchased* on or after May 28, not for travel *taken* on or after May 28. If you’ve already purchased your tickets for post-May 28 travel, you’re apparently golden. Do NOT cancel. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/11/southwest-airlines-charge-checked-bags.html"
2025-03-11 11:59,Which is absolutely ridiculous. I'm so pissed off. What is the actual perk then?
2025-03-11 12:13,I guess I'll need to get credit cards for my wife and children as well? Fuck them
2025-03-11 12:54,Is it one per flight? One per year? They don’t specify.
2025-03-11 13:00,Doesn't mean shit when you are a family and can only check one bag. Main reason we stayed loyal to them.
2025-03-11 12:46,They are not a budget airline. They are about the same as the big 3 now
2025-03-11 13:20,At least they aren’t charging for carry-ons…yet
2025-03-11 13:32,People that didn’t fly southwest before aren’t going to start now. But the question is how many people like you will really leave them? Any other airline will charge for bags as well. They’re playing the odds that not many will actually leave as it’s no advantage. So we’ll see.
2025-03-11 22:22,Golfer here and golf trips were nice on SWA!
2025-03-11 13:39,"Honestly as a consumer the limiting of free changes is way worse than the no free bags. But the free bags was so central to the brand identity. It's why people felt a certain attachment to SWA. Obviously not everyone will switch overnight, but I think it's pretty delusional of Elliott to think this won't have any impact."
2025-03-11 16:57,"It's a bit beside the point because SWA's marketing was very much centered around bags fly free and I think they'll take a hit because of that, but there's basically zero evidence that $TGT performing poorly has anything to do with its new DEI policy. They had been on a downward trend for over a year prior to Trump taking office and then subsequently bending at the knee. And their worst day in wallstreet back recently was back in November prior to their new policy (it was when they announced Q4 earnings). It's largely people on social media patting themselves on the back about how their boycott that they started a week ago is working when simply zooming out on the stock ticker tells a different story. A CEO farting has more correlation on stock price than DEI initiatives. Raytheon dropped theirs and is up 40% in the last year."
2025-03-12 02:58,"Went to a non-airport, Midwest Subway recently and found they’d just increased all subs from $12ish to $18…they hadn’t even changed the signage yet but the poor employee had to share that all sub pricing had just changed. Thanked ‘em and peaced the heck out. When you associate your whole brand with a certain identify (Southwest, Subway, and others - for many years), it’s a rug pull for everyone."
2025-03-11 13:08,"I am not a business traveler and I couldn't disagree more. If I traveled for business often, why wouldn't I pick any of the other airlines that could, say, fly you to Japan with points? To Europe? I chose SWA primarily because I do all my primary spend with their credit card and between that and the amount of travel I do, I got to go snowboarding for free every year (and check my board!). There's little to keep my loyal to SWA now - I will be looking into the United card personally."
2025-03-11 15:07,But SW often isn't the cheapest.
2025-03-11 12:38,"Already here. According to this, looks like they might be dropping Wanna Get Away and basic does not allow for free changes and flight credits expire in 6 months.

2025-03-11 11:55,We are at a point where it seems like management of companies isn’t even aligned with shareholders anymore. Epic Mountain is a good example. We are at a point there that shareholders/investors are telling them to reduce dividend and do what is right for long term growths instead of looking at short term profits.
2025-03-11 18:26,In the article it says current margin is 2% and pre Covid margin was 10% and that this is an attempt at getting back to that. Maybe a bigger question is where did 8% go. Once the fares got close to traditional carriers the value was gone. The kitchiness of the airline was lost during the pandemic.
2025-03-11 15:19,"Well on the bright side, no more have to pay extra for Early-Bird Check-in only to find out you have to pay MORE for a decent line position after having paid that extra money for Early-Bird Check-in. Fuck them."
2025-03-11 18:05,I remember 1990s ads where Southwest would use that phrase to differentiate it from competitors. Herb Kelleher is spinning so fast in his grave that he now qualifies as a renewable energy source. Fuck Elliot Management!
2025-03-11 14:33,Watch them change it back once they realize how they've f'd themselves!
2025-03-11 15:16,It’s not just SW. it’s everything. These people are going to sell Yosemite in the end ..
2025-03-11 15:16,"I was one of those people. It was inevitable. There is now zero reason to stay loyal and the only reasons I have to fly them are better routes out of AUS, that they fly to DAL at all, and the other airlines still suck more. For now anyway...just wait for the on-time performance to go straight down hill when the assigned seating nonsense starts."
2025-03-11 15:00,Except Spirit and Frontier are cheaper
2025-03-12 00:01,Spirit tier service at a legacy carrier price. I’m sure sales will surge!!
2025-03-11 14:38,I said this would happen when people were lauding the change to assigned seating. It was obvious checked bags were next. Companion pass will probably be gone in the same time frame
2025-03-11 11:59,Let’s see - using points on a multi-airline global network with full point earning and point redemption reciprocity? Or the airline with one partner coordinated through one US airport without full point reciprocity?
2025-03-11 13:08,"Flight credits will expire in six months if you buy the “basic” fare, which is the old “wanna get away” fare. And there are no free changes for that fare level. I was about to book a flight for October, and since that is more than six months away, it would be foolish to do so now. Who knows what else may change between now and then?"
2025-03-11 20:49,"Thank you for pointing this out. I am dismayed at how little attention that change is getting. When I saw the headline, the first thing I thought is whether they also changed their no expiration flight credits, which should be the headline IMO."
2025-03-11 11:21,Yea that’s exactly why it’s going to be so hard to switch. Almost every city i frequent regularly has directs from BWI that are sometimes significantly cheaper than other airlines WITH layovers. Along with the A/B terminal uplift I feel like SW has a strong hold on BWI for a LONG time 🤦🏽‍♂️
2025-03-11 12:14,I just got the email too. “We recognize these changes may be a disappointment to some”. Yea no shit
2025-03-11 11:26,"Interesting. I fly to Chicago, Boston, and Buffalo frequently and usually SW is the cheapest option (I usually fly the first flight or one of the last flights). But I haven’t really tried to look at the prices for the other airlines out of BWI lately due to “loyalty and points accumulation.” But now I’m going to take advantage of google flights now including SW fares and start seeing what other options there are."
2025-03-11 12:15,It's seriously a statement credit? LOL
2025-03-11 11:39,On Delta it’s automatic if you hold the card
2025-03-11 16:55,"The rewards from a halfway decent card (not just Airline cards) more than offset the cost of the fee and that's ***before*** you factor in the other benefits (extended warranty, rental car insurance, trip interruption insurance, etc.) such cards usually include."
2025-03-11 15:04,I never remembered Southwest having San Diego to Portland route. That must’ve been when I was flying Alaska to Portland pre-Covid. Oh well it’ll be nice to fly Alaska again. I can’t wait to have a cheese platter lol
2025-03-11 17:15,quickest weather racial edge cough rich growth flag pocket languid *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*
2025-03-11 16:54,Yeah buying last minute on SW has always been an absolute no-go for me. The prices booking less than a month out are ridiculous
2025-03-11 11:14,Good catch. Missed that on my read through the article.
2025-03-11 13:06,I’ve been messaging their customer service because we have a flight that I’ve already paid for coming up in November. And they said we will be affected by this new policy. False advertising indeed.
2025-03-11 14:21,FWIW you can get those same benefits with Delta or American by opening one of their stupid credit cards and paying 100 a year for the annual fees and get free bags for your entire party. Pays for itself if one person checks a bag round trip - the rest would just be straight savings. Main reason I got the American Air Aviator Red or the Delta Amex Skymiles Gold.
2025-03-11 12:54,"Fair point. My thought is that if SW is going to turn into the new Spirit or Frontier, I’ll take a quick layover vs. a direct. Most of my destinations (for work) involve a connection no matter the airline. But each situation is different."
2025-03-11 13:04,MDW might get interesting if people vote with their dollars. This airport relies on SW.
2025-03-11 13:14,"I’m trying to switch but it’s three nonstop options a day for $425 or at least one stop each way (usually the best schedule being in the opposite direction I need to go, so longer time) and $100-400 more. It’s so frustrating."
2025-03-11 11:56,Hasn’t Spirit figured that out yet
2025-03-11 17:20,"On my last trip with Delta, the check-in kiosk gave me the option to check my carry-on for free right at the ticket counter."
2025-03-11 11:43,CEO can only do so much against a hostile board
2025-03-11 12:52,Until now apparently
2025-03-11 12:49,EVERYONE NEEDS TO REPLY TO THE EMAIL THEY SENT. LET THEM KNOW!
2025-03-11 12:41,They slide that in behind the no free bags. Credits expire and free changes are only with premium tickets
2025-03-11 12:53,"If you carry a Southwest Credit Card, you get a free checked bag. If you’re A-List, some of the rules are different. They’ll be pumping the credit cards hard on the P-A system prior to landing."
2025-03-11 13:24,The stock isn’t surging. I reckon it’s time to ditch mine and short it.
2025-03-11 15:20,"Death spiral. Investors demand more revenue, more revenue. They, despite a wealth of information available, believe that gouging the customer will change nothing and just bring more money. So SWA that was known as cheap, fast, efficient with free bags, quick turn around at the gate, and plenty of direct routes. First after COVID dumped a ton of directs. Then came the on time rate being atrocious. Then ending open seating and charging for better seats. Now the end of free bags and a wealth of other nickel and diming. They will lose far more customers/revenue then they will gain from bag fees. That will then push the board to demand price increases, fewer perks, and continued reduction in labor. The customer/revenue will plummet, stock will plummet and they will be at full bankruptcy and dissolution or merger within 5 years. Brilliant work Elliot."
2025-03-11 13:46,I’m at BNA too and still a lot of flights are way more expensive then American from there. But yes it is annoying. I don’t see the advantage of flying them now.
2025-03-11 17:07,At BNA too. This is so frustrating 😩I will take a more expensive non stop any day
2025-03-11 15:07,"We have a similar situation. Southwest is the dominant airline out of STL, so I'm likely stuck with them. Guess if STL is the closest airport and it's still an hour and 45 minutes away, considering IND (2 hours + time change), MDW (3:15), and ORD (3:20) are options (in theory)."
2025-03-11 16:14,Alaska’s credit card allows one free checked bag for each person (up to 6) traveling on the same reservation. So SW policy seems particularly harsh. Not sure how the other biggies work.
2025-03-11 13:25,I am in the same boat and wondering if I only get 1 free bag or do I get 1 free for each of the (4) reservations? Maybe going to have to make all 4 reservations by themselves...
2025-03-11 13:16,Do you know how this affects a credit that I’ve already had for over 6 months? Ty
2025-03-11 15:24,"For me, this is the real difference. It’s going to be a madhouse now trying to fight for a seat and overhead space. As I get older, I find myself willing to pay a little more to avoid this madness. I’ll either pay for business select or explore other airlines."
2025-03-11 15:56,Now the overhead space will be even more jam packed.
2025-03-11 14:32,This was my question what if I have the SW credit card wouldn’t I at least get a free bag ? Cuz if not that’s ridiculous
2025-03-11 14:05,"But in the article it says that while charging for bags will bring in $1.5B in revenue, it will lose $1.8B because of people not booking with them. So they chose to ignore their own internal research and are taking short term loses anyway"
2025-03-11 11:46,Far to many of them are. I know of a few that go into investing in companies as long term partnership. This means they care more about 5 years from now than next quarter and target the future. Those are the good ones.
2025-03-12 01:11,"hogwash, they are the smrtest people in the room. they told me that themselves."
2025-03-11 13:48,"They should be made illegal, I swear. All they do is go in pillage a company for any chance of a short-term profit, and then when it is inevitably failing, they sell it off and wash their hands of the whole thing. Meanwhile, we, the customers, are left with fewer options and, of course, higher costs."
2025-03-11 17:16,It’s so bizarre that in 2025 Spirit offers first class and Southwest charges for bags and seats.
2025-03-11 13:44,They were talking about canceling the credit card
2025-03-11 16:58,Not if you update your flight. For example if your flight drops in price and you change to your flight then you are subject to the new rules.
2025-03-11 13:08,"I don't know how SWA will implement it, but other airlines' credit cards waive the bag fees for each ticket you purchase with the card. Delta doesn't even require that, they just tie the card benefit to your account and waive the fees for everyone on your itinerary, even if you don't pay with the actual Delta card."
2025-03-11 13:13,This is my question. We have a Southwest card that both my husband and I carry but it’s the same account. Does that mean we both get to check a bag or do I need to get a separate account?
2025-03-11 14:37,And SW credit card charges a $75 fee every year it’s not worth it tbh I’m canceling mine soon
2025-03-11 13:10,They also don’t say whether it will get your companions a free bag or just you. Southwest used to be the best airline for families.
2025-03-11 14:01,"Except the big three at least have better flight experiences. If you aren’t going to have the physical quality on par with them, then you need to do stuff like SW did"
2025-03-11 14:37,Yet…
2025-03-11 15:04,Have no doubt it’s just a matter of time now.
2025-03-11 14:34,"I can’t speak for others but I live in Denver where SW and United both have hubs. Previously, my first search would be SW because of Bags Fly Free, even though the flying experience was no better/no worse. Now? I’ll check United first because they offer more options and (right or wrong) in my mind it’s a marginally more premium experience. Without BFF policy, what does SW offer?"
2025-03-11 13:56,"I’m certainly not going to fly Southwest over another airline that will get me there direct. I’m frustrated that the only airline that flies direct from Tampa to Cleveland is frontier, because I fly to Cleveland at least once a year. Southwest has been my go to airline for years."
2025-03-11 13:41,"Southwest historically in my experience has terrible rates of cancelled/delayed flights and options for rebooking layovers are terrible (1-2 days sometimes). Once they offered me a $200 voucher for an issue on their part and I never received it. I argued on the phone with them for hours and hours. Literally the only reason I fly them are the free bags. I even get one free on delta with my card, but often I needed two because I travel for long increments sometimes. Also because they are changing the wanna get away and flexibility, there is just no point any more. I will definitely stop flying them after this"
2025-03-11 17:09,"I've checked a bag once in the 30 flights I've taken over the past few years (and an a card holder), so the change doesn't really affect me...but it's so fucking traitorous the brand. It's not hyperbole at this juncture, this isn't Southwest anymore. It's just another carrier."
2025-03-11 13:51,"Or, this is a ""test the waters"" approach. See what the public does/says after the dust settles and go from there."
2025-03-11 20:20,"There's some that will stick with it regardless for sure but many will flee. I disagree with SW being a ""worse"" experience than other airlines but people do view it as a budget airline and if the option to ""upgrade"" to Delta, United, or AA is now there due to a bag check fee people will do it. I'll stick it out for a bit with SW, Love field is just so much damn better than DFW, but it hurts my soul that they are doing this."
2025-03-11 15:44,"Yeah, my ski trips and checking my snowboard + regular bag for free was a GIANT part of why I used SW. I guess there's no reason to use them anymore. I'll use my companion pass this year and all my points, then go airline agnostic."
2025-03-11 18:03,"At this point, why not drop the heart as a company logo considering those in Elliot Management absolutely lack one."
2025-03-11 13:48,The wording is so poor. Can you still cancel and get points returned to you?
2025-03-11 15:40,"This makes no sense. Cancellations All fares types are eligible for cancelations without a fee. For changes to a flight itinerary with Wanna Get Away Plus®, Anytime, and Business Select®, there is no fee, though a fare difference may apply. Failure to cancel a reservation at least 10 minutes prior to scheduled departure may result in forfeited travel funds. There’s no difference between cancelling and rebooking and rebooking with a fare difference."
2025-03-11 14:59,Obligatory F*ck Vail.
2025-03-11 19:59,For the East Coast and Midwest its on par with cost to fly to Switzerland and ski the alps compared to going to Vail.
2025-03-11 16:49,"We need to do away with the compensation model that rewards the C-Suite with shares instead of cash. The banner headlines, ""This CEO makes $30,000,000, that one makes $60,000,000"" most of that compensation is stock awards. They might get $1,000,000 in actual salary and the rest in shares. So the incentive absolutely is to do whatever is necessary to juice the share price in the short term rather than risk taking it on the chin for long term gains. Tilting at windmills here, neither one of us can fix it, but it occurs to me if I were dictator for a day I'd put a cap on stock awards as compensation. If the CEO actually is a mad crazy genius, pay them well with cash and let them buy the shares on the open market, like the rest of us plebs."
2025-03-12 05:23,"They all went to the Jack Welch MBA school, obviously."

2025-03-11 20:45,"I didn't get the email, but that type of smarmy wording only makes me angrier."
2025-03-11 12:59,They need the revenue numbers
2025-03-11 17:02,Technically this is better since you get some extra SW points for the bag fee then. Look I'm just trying to find some silver linings here!
2025-03-11 16:17,"From the press release: ""Changes will apply to flights booked on or after May 28, 2025."" So I believe that whoever you talked to was incorrect. When you purchase tickets, they very explicitly say that the first 2 bags are free, so there would be legal implications for them if they didn't honor that."
2025-03-11 16:44,"Negative, the message states all flights *booked* after May 28. You should be unaffected."
2025-03-11 13:29,Same-We have a flight booked for July and I said “it was advertised as two bags are free” and the agent said sorry but this new policy will affect your flight. With that said-how much are bags?
2025-03-11 16:46,I'd believe the actual press release over a random agent.
2025-03-11 13:10,"I agree! Our airport always has a ton of Orlando flights, since so many people go to Disney/Universal. Many of those people are families, who are probably bringing a ton of stuff for their time at the parks with small children, where the 2 free bags helps. It will definitely be interesting to see how that plays out!"
2025-03-11 13:54,This is basically the reason I fly SW the mostZ. My family lives 10 minutes away from MDW and I live 12 minutes from Love Field. I’ll start paying more attention to dollars and cents and have to make a choice that way.
2025-03-11 14:06,For real! MDW is basically Southwest plus friends.
2025-03-11 12:47,They will do the Ryan air /Spririt thing and charge a crazy amount if you have to gate check.
2025-03-11 13:04,Baloney. Elliott doesn’t control the whole board. Jordan could have grown a spine and said they aren’t changing their core differentiator in the market. He was so scared of a proxy fight or Elliott removing him that he gutted the company. It’s a complete lack of leadership.
2025-03-11 12:58,Pretty sure you can't reply to the email as those are usually sent from a mailbox that doesn't receive mail (the email address is [bounce@iluv.southwest.com](mailto:bounce@iluv.southwest.com)). But I do suggest people flood them with emails through the support center [https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us](https://support.southwest.com/helpcenter/s/email-us)
2025-03-11 14:25,[Source ](https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-flight-credits-expire/)for the credit expiration change
2025-03-11 23:02,"Free bags were great for vacations, but the free changes and non-expiring credits was the #1 sell for me. I often just carry on a bag. (they were allowing the old carry on dimensions that no one else allows anymore). I wonder if they are also going to reduce carry on size now. Expiring credits and lack of free changes leaves me with no reason to use them. The prices are pretty much the same as everyone else, but with only basic economy seats and the lack of flights to certain airports. I fly to Texas a lot and they don't fly to at least two of the larger airports I prefer to fly to anymore. I've got like 8 flights booked right now and will likely need to move 1/4 of them due to schedule conflicts that arise. I will probably end up driving more often when I can't be sure of my schedule if I can't get flexible tickets. The only thing that Southwest still has going for them is their loving staff that seem to bend over backwards to help you out or bend rules to get you home where most airlines would find a way to keep you off the plane and charge you fees. I feel bad for them knowing that Southwest is probably cutting stuff from them as well."
2025-03-11 13:26,SWA branded card is reimbursed for one free checked bag. We’ll get charged then credited on statement.
2025-03-11 13:25,Same on Delta. One free bag with the credit card. Big deal.
2025-03-11 14:32,"Interrupt that announcement with a very loud ""What happened to our free bag?"""
2025-03-12 01:18,"They no longer allow points to roll over to the next year, so what's the point? They will no longer be getting my $65K a year business on their card."
2025-03-11 14:31,It's LITERALLY up 10% today.
2025-03-11 17:46,"Everything is unstable, especially with current politics throwing grenades into the stock market. The biggest example is NVIDIA. Put the scale back to 5 years. That mountain starting from last January shouldn't be there. That's a balloon getting ready to pop. Southwest doing these decisions right when the market is like this is like they're begging for the airline to fall apart. I guess it was good that I never bought SWA stocks in the end."
2025-03-11 13:24,They said they stay.
2025-03-11 17:29,"It's not a loss for the Private Equity. It's $1.5B into their own books (fees for their service, sometimes even transfering more debt to their companies that they plan to bankrupt, taking a loss on those companies thus making more money), then load the airline itself with $1.8B in debt (Not the $300m they really loss). Once you milk it and get to the point where banks won't loan you money, you've probably made $10B for the PE company. Then they just declare bankruptcy and sell off the rest making even more money. This is how most PE works. Easy solution: Limit bankruptcy to a certain amount, say $1B. Banks would then never lend above that. And limit transfers of assets and tax them at enormous rates. No deduction for debt transfers within a PE. This strategy will end quickly."
2025-03-11 18:15,People love talking shit about spirit but personally I like them. The big seat is usually either booked up or priced way above what I want to pay. But it's so nice to fly in!!!!!
2025-03-11 13:42,This is my question. Like I buy my wife and daughters tickets on my card. We dont need 2 and i cant get one for a 12 year old
2025-03-11 15:32,"It sounds like, no matter how many tickets you buy, you will get one bag CREDITED back, so you will still pay for all three and then get a credit for one bag on your next statement."
2025-03-11 13:37,"I agree, and this is a major concern of mine (mother of 5). I’ve been a SWA priority card member for years. Delta’s card allows you one free checked bag for every member of your party. I’m not seeing this here."
2025-03-11 13:53,"This is my big question. I have a companion pass for my husband, so does he get a free checked bag as well?"
2025-03-11 15:25,"I don’t have your easy United option. SWA has the most flights from my airport by far and all the legacy carrier flights go through hubs. I’ll probably change airlines soon though. None of SWA’s perks work for me. The biggest change will be the assigned seats. If I change my flight for various business reasons today, I can always get an aisle as an A-List. But that won’t be true soon as all those will be booked and assigned. I’ll have to worry about seat availability just like UA, AA, DL. I don’t check bags except for long vacations. I generally don’t get excited about points to fly in the US for vacation. I do that enough already. I want points and status to get a lay-flat seat to EU or Asia and club access. I may finally grab a United card with club access and deal with ORD/DEN/EWR layovers. SWA is now just another airline with less perks for a frequent flier. The only difference is their lack of a hub system."
2025-03-11 16:55,"This. If you live in a region with legacy vs SW like Denver, Chicago, NY etc, I think the SW hubs in those regions will be greatly harmed by these decisions."
2025-03-11 23:14,And international flights And Star Alliance And lounges And better credit cards I could keep going but the point is made
2025-03-11 15:55,Same! I'm rethinking my and my husband's entire card strategy. Either might lean into united or might just rethink airline loyalty entirely and have my husband get a sapphire.
2025-03-12 01:44,All they have to do is turn the heart upside down and it reflects their new business and what they think of customers.
2025-03-11 15:47,"My guess is they will not allow you to do a simple change or force a fee. If you want to change you will need to cancel for credits and rebook which makes it more complicated and probably not worth it for small changes for most people. What would be really insidious is if the ""delay"" the credit to the next day and now you might lose the cheaper fare if price increases while waiting for the credit."
2025-03-11 16:03,"Also, at least while it's still open seating, you'll lose Early bird if you paid for it when cancelling."
2025-03-12 01:37,It was cheaper for me to go to Switzerland AND enjoy an extra day in Iceland along the way.
2025-03-11 17:03,"They should only have long term stock incentives, if any at all."
2025-03-11 13:16,Good point.
2025-03-11 13:23,"While Elliott does control 5 of the 15 board members, that means they also just need to convince 3 more board members (if things like this require a simple majority vote) to force these changes. Maybe those 3 were never on board, but Jordan didn't call their bluff. It's a shame. I was expecting WGA going to just 1 free checked bag (that was a compromise I could make), but to remove it entirely is such a drastic and bad change. I rarely check a bag with SWA, but I understand why their old policy was there, and it was nice to have it as an option."
2025-03-11 14:09,"Just sent their customer service an email: ""I have been a Rapid Rewards credit card holder for the last 7 years. I have exclusively flown Southwest during this time and have recommended them to everyone I know. I have never had a negative experience flying Southwest, with employees often brightening my day and adding a little fun to my journey. Even when my suitcases were run over at the beginning of my trip this past January, customer service was amazing and got me taken care of right away. In short, I have no complaints whatsoever about the staff of Southwest. The board and C Suite on the other hand, is a different story. I was incredibly disappointed to receive an email this morning that the free checked bag policy was going away. In addition, the flexible fares and free cancellation also appear to be getting the axe. With assigned seating being implemented, it looks like everything I loved about this airline will be gone by May of this year. Even your incredible staff cannot make up the difference. I only regret that they will likely face the steepest consequences from any negative blowback from these decisions. I know that I am not a frequent flyer, so my opinion does not carry any weight, but I WAS a loyal customer. """
2025-03-11 16:03,"I received an email from Southwest. When they expire depends on the ticket grade. For the lowest grade, they'll expire in 6 months. Other ticket levels will expire in 12 months."
2025-03-11 19:56,Sounds like rapid rewards points still don’t expire at least? Just flight credits. Just taking sure. The wife hoards her rr points.
2025-03-11 13:38,"It is actually reimbursed, so you still have to purchase it with your RR card, which somehow makes this all feel more egregious. Also, I was hoping maybe it would be one credited bag per traveler when you use your RR card, but alas of course not"
2025-03-11 14:01,"Do you know if it's a one-time free checked bag or if it's for each flight on the credit card? It's kind of ambiguous to me. The way the early bird check-in credits worked were you buy it and it came back as a credit on your card like you are describing, but it was limited to 2 per year for the mid-tier credit card."
2025-03-11 14:58,"Really. So that seems like a PITA. My wife and I both have our own RR credit cards and typically only travel on RR points. So sounds as though we will now need to travel on separate itineraries in order to use our individual cards to purchase bag fees and be reimbursed for the bag benefit. We don't fly often, but checked bags was a great benefit for family vacations when travelling with our kids for a week+."
2025-03-11 14:00,"It's unclear to me if it's one per flight or one per year (like the 4 card reimbursements / year for upgraded boarding). Wonder if as an A-List card holder, you get 2 free checked bags (1 for A-List, 1 for card)."
2025-03-11 14:51,But yet still down 6% from just two weeks ago…
2025-03-11 23:03,Precisely. Private equity doesn’t lose even if they buy a business and it fails. Often times designed to fail by private equity.
2025-03-11 23:54,"I think it's going to be heavily airport dependent. In places where SW is dominant, they'll still be fine. But like the other comment mentioned Denver, which is my airport as well, I'll absolutely not search SW first like I always have. United has more directs here. And plenty of other major metros have tons of good flight options that SW loyalists mostly ignore bc of their allegiance to the SW experience. I'd bet those people look at other options now! My parents are strictly SW for decades but between the bag change and open seating gone, they don't get any benefit anymore. Their Chase points transfer to United, too. SW let me check my snowboard/boots bag included and that's a huge winter benefit, too. Gone. Just another example."
2025-03-11 16:30,"I used to fly southwest and have been loyal to United. I'll say this. I do like the perks of their cards, lounges are nice (although in some airports, they leave a lot to be desired) but imo you might be better off with the sapphire unless you're a business traveler. I had 12 legs last year, enough for me to become a Silver with United...EXCEPT I didn't spend enough money somehow? They tie the status to flights plus spend or just spend (but then the amount increases). It seems simple to get there but they have consistently increased it. Basically I like United but unless you're a business traveler it's almost better to just shop the cheapest airline rather than be brand loyal as most loyalty perks are only achievable for business travelers."
2025-03-11 14:16,"Other airlines like Delta have this simply by having their base credit card. Southwest is limiting checked bag allowance to their highest tier fliers. Screw Southwest, there is no need to fly them anymore."
2025-03-11 17:07,6 months?! That’s ridiculous.
2025-03-11 16:32,"If I’m reading that article correctly, the flight credits currently on accounts will not expire? My mom has some from a canceled flight a year ago so I’m wondering if I need to push her to use them"
2025-03-11 14:20,A reimbursement. With deltas it's just free. That's so shady it sounds like they're just trying to make money by reinvesting your money and holding it from you for days.
2025-03-11 17:09,I also have the AA card and it’s a free bag for traveler. I got that one ages ago when we decided to take the kids to Hawaii and the savings on the suitcases covered the annual fee for a couple years. This is a terrible decision by Southwest.
2025-03-11 23:15,"Yeah that's bullshit. No other airline does that. I get a free checked bag for having co-branded Delta, AA and JetBlue cards and I don't pay upfront then get reimbursed."
2025-03-11 15:22,"JetBlue cardholders get one bag per person on a reservation (i.e. 4 tickets = 4 checked bags). I would hope SWA at least offers the same benefit, but I’m not holding my breath with all of these other negative changes."
2025-03-11 14:50,"SWA and Chase haven't announced how their credit cards will change moving forward (as the benefits are still tied to the old system). My guess is that those cards will also allow a free checked bag as a way to incentivize people to get the credit cards. It's still a shame, though. edit: Also just got the email about credit cards including a checked bag, so it will be similar to all the other airlines."
2025-03-11 18:16,"If Southwest cancelled the flight, she is entitled to a refund."
2025-03-11 14:51,"Yup, it was a great run, but in the end, as they so often do, private equity kills another one."
2025-03-11 15:11,"Yeah there is zero reasons for me to pay $150 a year for a card that carries no real benefit. Still waiting to see how Chase and SWA aligns the benefit to the new chosen seating policy. I'd assume it will be the same, in that your 4 upgrades will apply to the legroom, exit rows, first dibs to choose, etc. If the card doesn't incentivize covering at least a bag. I'm dumping the card and SW for a Delta based card.."
